# Photographer Portfolio

What-to-be Portfolio Web Application for one Photographer to showcase their works.

To get to something "presentable" quickly, this first iteration will display public photos
published in one Flickr account.

# Getting started

I created this application using `rails new photo-port --asset-pipeline=propshaft
--css=tailwind` with Ruby on Rails version 7.0.2.3 and Ruby 3.1.1p18.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version: 3.1.1, managed by [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/).a See
  [.tool-versions](.tool-versions), [.ruby-version](.ruby-version) and
  [Gemfile](Gemfile)
* System dependencies
* Configuration
* Database creation
* Database initialization
* How to run the test suite
* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
* Deployment instructions
* ...
